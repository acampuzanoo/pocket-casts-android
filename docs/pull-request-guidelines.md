# Pull Request Guidelines

## Main Branch

The `main` branch represents the latest version. This is what you want to fork and base your feature branch on. This is the default GitHub branch.

## Branch Naming

Branch names should use the following pattern.

`fix/` = fix an existing issue  
`update/` = update an existing feature  
`add/` = add a new feature  
`remove/` = remove an existing feature  

Some examples are `add/sleep-timer` and `fix/notifications-crash`.

## Commits

As you commit code to these branches, donâ€™t tag the issue number in the individual commit messages as it pollutes the pull request and makes it messier. Just attach the issue number to the final pull request. Before you submit your final pull request, make sure all your branches are up to date with `main`.

## Version Tags

All released versions are tagged with the version number. For example, the 7.19.2 production release will be tagged as `7.19.2`.

## Raise a Pull Request

When you are ready, please, spend time crafting a good Pull Request, since it will have a huge impact on the work of reviewers, release managers and testers.

We have a [Pull Request template](../.github/pull_request_template.md) to help.
